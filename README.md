# Seinfeld Script Generator using a RNN
 
This project was created for the Deep Learning NanoDegree program for Udacity. 

Using a sample set of data, specifically Seinfeld episode scripts, it trains a RNN and uses that to create new scripts.

While the scripts this RNN generates aren't always coherent, it tends to create sentences and the appearance of dialogue
